# CE103 HW-2

2nd Homework assignment for Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, class CE103.

We're required to develop the functions that have been left empty in [ce103-hw2-test-app.c](ce103-hw2/ce103-hw2-test-app.c),
after which we'll need to generate a documentation using [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl). The way we're asked to do is pretty
old, provided the project was initially made in Visual Studio Community Edition 201x, and was upgraded to VSCE 2022 by the
teacher himself. The only restrictions are to not change anything in function signatures and unit tests. The unit tests MUST
pass if we need full mark.

For TODO, see #1.
